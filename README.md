# Customer Behavior Prediction using Random Forest

## Project Overview
This project employs machine learning techniques to predict customer behavior based on purchasing patterns. By utilizing a Random Forest classifier, customers are categorized as either **Bargain Hunters** or **Premium Buyers**. The goal is to build an accurate predictive model and visualize insights into feature importance and classification results.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Prepares the dataset for analysis by ensuring consistency in column names and target mapping.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Implements a robust model for classification.
- **Model Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
- **Visualizations**:
  - Confusion Matrix Heatmap
  - Feature Importance Plot
  - Distribution of Customer Types

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`

Install these libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
